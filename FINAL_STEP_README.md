# 🚀 FINAL STEP - Add Placeholder Images to Your Live Website

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

1. ✅ Updated code to use Supabase Storage for images (instead of dead render.com URL)
2. ✅ Built the project successfully (789.77 kB)
3. ✅ Pushed to GitHub (commit 83d6a11)
4. ✅ Vercel will auto-deploy in ~2 minutes

## 🎯 Your Action Required (5 MINUTES ONLY!)

### STEP 1: Run SQL Script (3 minutes)

1. **Click this link**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rbxrelsauoqytwifdteq/sql/new

2. **Open the file**: `ADD_PLACEHOLDER_IMAGES.sql` (in your project folder)

3. **Copy ALL the SQL code** from that file

4. **Paste into Supabase SQL Editor**

5. **Click "RUN"** button (bottom right)

6. **Wait for "Success"** message

✅ This will add professional placeholder images to ALL your content:
- 9 leadership photos (generated from names)
- 7 partner logos (including Restoring AgriSolution)
- 7 news images (beautiful stock photos)
- 4 event images (community photos)
- 8 gallery photos (agriculture/training images)

### STEP 2: Verify Your Website (2 minutes)

1. **Wait 2 minutes** for Vercel to finish deploying

2. **Visit your Vercel site** (the URL you used before)

3. **Check these pages**:
   - ✅ Home page: Should show partner logos in carousel
   - ✅ Partners page: Should show 7 partners (including Restoring AgriSolution)
   - ✅ Leadership page: Should show 9 people with professional avatars
   - ✅ News page: Should show 7 articles with images
   - ✅ Events page: Should show 4 events with images
   - ✅ Admin page: Go to `/admin-new` and login:
     - Email: `admin@carcrt.org`
     - Password: `CArCRT2025Admin!`

## 🎉 Expected Result

Your website will now show:
- ✅ ALL data from database (partners, leadership, news, events)
- ✅ Professional placeholder images (avatars and stock photos)
- ✅ "Restoring AgriSolution Enterprises" in Partners section
- ✅ No more "No partners added yet" messages
- ✅ Fully functional admin dashboard

## 📸 About the Placeholder Images

The SQL script uses:
- **UI Avatars** for people and organization logos (auto-generated from names)
- **Unsplash** for high-quality stock photos (free, professional images)

These are TEMPORARY placeholders. When you have your real images:
1. Upload them to Supabase Storage (see `SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
2. Update the database paths

But for now, your site will look PROFESSIONAL and COMPLETE! 🎨
