                </h2>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  CArCRT was founded to address the growing needs for community resilience, inclusive
                  leadership, and sustainable development across Sierra Leone. Recognizing the complex
                  challenges facing communities—from health crises to environmental changes, from social
                  inequities to economic vulnerabilities our founders came together with a shared vision
                  of empowering communities to lead their own transformation.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Starting from our base in Kenema, Eastern Province, we began working directly with
                  local communities, listening to their needs, understanding their challenges, and
                  co-creating solutions that would have lasting impact.

                  Growth & Expansion
                </h2>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Since its establishment, CArCRT has grown into a respected national coalition working
                  with civil society, local leaders, development partners, and grassroots communities.
                  Our work has expanded across multiple thematic areas, reflecting the interconnected
                  nature of community challenges and the need for holistic approaches.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Today, we operate within 5 districts in Sierra Leone, empowering thousands of
                  individuals and strengthening local systems through evidence-based programming,
                  advocacy, and community engagement.

                </h2>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Through our journey, we have implemented over 15 projects, reached more than 15,000
                  community members, and built lasting partnerships with organizations that share our
                  commitment to community transformation.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Our approach has always centered on community ownership ensuring that the initiatives
                  we support are led by community members themselves, creating sustainable change that
                  continues long after our direct involvement ends.
